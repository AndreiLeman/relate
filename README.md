Relate is a library built to use together with Redux and GraphQL. You can think of it as an alternative to [Relay](https://github.com/facebook/relay) for Redux. It extends the [React Redux's](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) `connect` where you can additionally specify your container's data needs. Relate will resolve each container data needs automatically and provides it to each one the data they requested.

Relate follows a similar API to Relay, it isn't a replacement but an alternative to it with some more liberty which might be a better fit for some projects.
